Awake for Debug allows you to keep your screen awake while Wireless or USB debugging is active.

It switches to the previously set display timeout when the device is unplugged.

Permissions:
- WRITE_SETTINGS to set the display timeout.
- INTERNET for Crashlytics (crash reports)

Note: If the app crashes, please send the crash report so that I can fix it. No user-specific information is sent, only information related to the crash (stacktrace) and device information like OS version, free space, rooted/non-rooted, free RAM, etc, is sent.
